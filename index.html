                <p class="about">Chris Bumstead is an IFBB Classic Physique Professional bodybuilder and sponsored athlete from Canada. He is the current Classic Physique Olympia champion (2019, 2020 and 2021).</br>
                    </br>Chris Bumstead is from Ottawa, Canada. As a kid, he looked up to the legendary Tom Platz because of his iconic leg development. He also cited Barry Demay (80s bodybuilder) as one his inspirations, and, of course, the great Arnold Schwarzenegger.
                    Bumstead built the base of his physique training for sports that he was involved with in high school such as football, basketball and ran track and field.<br></br>He was introduced to bodybuilding through his sister’s boyfriend (now
                    husband) Iain Valliere, who is also an IFBB Professional bodybuilder. Valliere saw potential in Bumstead and helped him to prepare for his competition in 2014, when he was just 19 years old. He has acknowledged Valliere as being someone
                    he’s inspired by and who he still looks up to. Bumstead really found his home in the Classic Physique division and it seems he wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.
